Greetings, fellow shinobi! My name is Joshua Umahi, a proud member of Konohagakure's Frontend Team. I specialize in creating immersive and user-friendly interfaces that make the user experience as smooth as a chakra flow.

With my trusty coding jutsus, I aim to deliver the best web applications for our village's needs. From HTML to CSS, from React to Vue, I am constantly improving my skills to stay ahead of the competition.

But that's not all! Recently, I've been delving into the ways of the backend shinobi as well. With the power of Node.js and MongoDB, I seek to expand my knowledge and become a full-stack ninja.
